# ACTUM Digital Accessibility

A portal of ACTUM Digital projects dedicated to web accessibility.

The website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

```
$ yarn
```

### Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

The static build is automatically deployed on each push to the `main` branch - either directly or via the pull request.

### Contribution

We appreciate any kind of contribution that helps us share the information about the web accessibility knowledge better. Should you have any suggestion on what to add, edit, or remove, please, create an issue.
