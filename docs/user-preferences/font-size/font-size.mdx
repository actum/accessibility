# Font size

(future video slot)

Font size refers to how big or small the text appears on the screen. It is an important part of web design, affecting how easily people can read and interact with online content.

## Benefits

The ability to adjust the font size has several advantages:

- **Better readability**: Bigger text is easier to read, especially for people with vision impairments.
- **User preference**: Everyone has their own comfort level with text size, depending on their eyesight or the device they are using.
- **Eye comfort**: Adjusting font size to a comfortable level can decrease eye strain and fatigue, particularly during long periods of reading or screen use.

## Adjusting Font Size

Users can change font sizes in several ways:

- **Operating System Scale**: Changes the scale of everything, including text, across the entire system.
- **Browser Zoom**: Enlarges or shrinks everything on a webpage.
- **Browser Font Size Option**: Specifically changes text size but may not work on all websites.
- **Assistive Technology**: Tools like screen magnifiers or readers help people with vision impairments by enlarging everything on the scren.

## The Problem of Pixels

While the methods above usually work, there is a catch with the browser font size option. If a website uses pixel (<code>px</code>) units for text, it might ignore the browser's font size settings. This is because pixels are a fixed size - they do not change when you adjust browser settings. So, if a developer does not code their site to work with these settings, the text will not resize as it should, making the site less accessible.

## The Solution of Relative Units

The solution to the pixels problem lies in using relative units like <code>rem</code> for font sizes. Unlike pixels, <code>rem</code> (root em) units are relative to the root element's font size. This means that if the root font size changes (like when a user adjusts their browser's font size settings), the text size defined in <code>rem</code> will scale accordingly.

## Implementation

The following example demonstrates how you can implement font size in relative units. Users can benefit from their font size browser's settings only when the website has implemented the support for it.

  This snippet includes a paragraph of text accompanied by CSS styling. The style rules set the <code>font-size</code> to <code>100%</code> for the <code>html</code> element, aligning the entire document's base font size with the browser's settings.

Additionally, there's a <code>.description</code> class which specifies a <code>font-size</code> of <code>1.25rem</code>. This means the font size for elements with the <code>.description</code> class will be 1.25 times the base font size. For instance, if the base font size is <code>16px</code>, then the text in the <code>.description</code> class will be rendered at <code>20px</code>.

```
<style>
  html { font-size: 100%; }

  .description { font-size: 1.25rem; }
</style>

<p class="description">This text has font size in rem units. It does respect the font size settings of the browser.</p>  
```
</details>

[Adjust the font size of your browser](#font-size-instructions-browser) and compare the following two texts defined by <code>px</code> and <code>rem</code> units to see how the units respect your browser settings.
