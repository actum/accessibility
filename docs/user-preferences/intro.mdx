The User Preferences project showcases options users can set to **customize their web-browsing experience**. Users have many customization options today, however, while certain user preferences take effect across all websites once set in the operating system (such as zoom or resolution changes), others **require implementation from developers** to function appropriately - **light, dark, or high-contrast (forced colors) mode, reduced motion mode, or font size preferences** - we are focusing on these. Without proper implementation and support, these user preferences would be ignored or might not work properly.

Not all users are aware such preference options exist or where to find them. It is best to **design websites with accessibility in mind** already to accommodate wide range of users so less users might actually need to set less custom preferences. This does not apply to everyone - some people need more customizations than standard websites may offer, such as zoom over 500% with a magnifier software, set own custom colors, or use different assistive technologies.

Learn about these user preferences, how to support them with some implementation tips, and what it could mean for users if the preferences are not respected.

There are also videos (explaining the details) available for each user preference. Check the following video that gives you an introduction to the project.
