Inaccessible components aim to **educate** developers and anyone interested in web accessibility.

A collection of inaccessible components demonstrates **common accessibility and usability issues** developers create (mostly unintentionally) when building websites.

By realizing the impact of the issues, developers can understand **what kind of barriers are various users facing** so they can start remediating the issues, and learn how to create more accessible components. We believe it is important to know what to do, but also what not to do.

There are many patterns and ways how to make certain components accessible, including various options and features components can have. There might be multiple ways to deal with certain issues, and rather than covering all of the possible approaches, this project focuses on **demonstrating the issues and showing one way of fixing them**.

There are also videos (explaining the issues) available for each component. Check the following video that gives you an introduction to the project.
