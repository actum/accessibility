### Issues

Expand each issue to see the user impact.

<details>
  <summary>
    <span>Breadcrumb links have no visual focus.</span>
  </summary>
  Although the breadcrumb links are accessible by keyboard, sighted keyboard users cannot see where they are focused as there is no visual focus indicator. They are lost in the darkness.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>
    <span>There is not enough contrast between links and the background colors.</span>
  </summary>
  Users with moderately low vision cannot read the text because they do not see it.

    rel="noreferrer noopener"

</details>
<details>
  <summary>
    <span>The set of links is structured using an unordered list.</span>
  </summary>
  Breadcrumb links follow the site structure, so the order of links is important. The ordered list should be used instead so users know of the hierarchy.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>
    <span>The breadcrumb navigation is not easily located for <a href="/docs/wcag-documents/glossary-of-terms#screen-reader">screen reader</a> users.</span>
  </summary>
  The <code>nav</code> element with a proper label should be used to identify the breadcrumb as a navigation [landmark](/docs/wcag-documents/glossary-of-terms#landmark-region).
</details>
<details>
  <summary>
    <span>The link separators create a redundant and potentially distracting verbosity for screen reader users.</span>
  </summary>
  To prevent screen readers' announcement of the visual separators between links, they should be added via CSS or hidden from assistive technologies.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>
    <span>The <code>aria-label</code> attributes on links are unnecessary and invalid.</span>
  </summary>
  There is no reason to put the <code>aria-label</code> on the breadcrumb links as the title inside the link is descriptive enough.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>
    <span>The last item in the breadcrumb is not marked as the currently active link.</span>
  </summary>
  The last link should have the <code>aria-current</code> attribute to indicate the current item within a set of related elements and let users know they are currently on this page.

</details>
<details>
  <summary>
    <span>The layout breaks on smaller resolutions.</span>
  </summary>
  The breadcrumb items do not wrap on smaller resolutions causing content overflow and a horizontal scrollbar appears.
</details>

### Considerations

The usage of certain techniques depends on the circumstances. Expand each consideration to learn more.

<details>
  <summary>
    <span>Consider shortening the breadcrumb trail on small resolutions.</span>
  </summary>
  Sometimes, a single breadcrumb pointing up one level on smaller resolutions or mobile screens might be sufficient for key user goals. For instance, on an e-commerce site, a product-detail page could have a breadcrumb leading to the parent category, helping users explore related products without taking up excessive screen space.
