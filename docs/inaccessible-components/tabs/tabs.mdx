### Issues

Expand each issue to see the user impact.

<details>
    <summary>
    <span>The tab list and tab panel are not next to each other.</span>
  </summary>
    Both list and panel should be next to each other - both visually and in DOM. With screen magnification software or large zoom, it may be impossible to detect tab panel switching.
</details>
<details>
    <summary>
    <span>Tabs are focusable but not interactive.</span>
  </summary>
    Although it is possible to tab through tabs, it is not possible to activate the tab by a keyboard.
</details>
<details>
    <summary>
    <span>Tab panels are hidden only visually.</span>
  </summary>
    Inactive tab panels are still accessible by keyboard and their content is discoverable. This can confuse visual users and destroys the purpose of tabs for <a href="/docs/wcag-documents/glossary-of-terms#screen-reader">screen reader</a> users in the first place.
</details>
<details>
    <summary>
    <span>Missing ARIA attributes.</span>
  </summary>
    Tabs are a custom JavaScript widget, there is no native HTML element to use for that. Therefore, a couple of attributes need to be added:
    <ul>
        <li><code>role=&quot;tablist&quot;</code> - a wrapper for the list of tabs</li>
        <li><code>role=&quot;tab&quot;</code> - a tab control also providing a label for the connected tabpanel</li>
        <li><code>role=&quot;tabpanel&quot;</code> - a wrapper for the tab panel content</li>
        <li><code>aria-labelledby</code> on the tablist to provide an <a href="/docs/wcag-documents/glossary-of-terms#accessible-name">accessible name</a></li>
        <li><code>aria-selected</code> on the tab to indicate selected tabs</li>
        <li><code>aria-controls</code> on the tab to connect tab with tabpanel</li>
        <li><code>tabindex</code> on the tab to control the tab sequence of tabs</li>
        <li><code>aria-labelledby</code> on the tabpanel to provide an accessible name</li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
    <summary>
    <span>Missing keyboard support.</span>
  </summary>
    To make the component accessible and convenient to use for keyboard users, the following key support should be added:
    <br />
    <ul>
        <li>The <code>Tab</code> key - tabbing into the tablist should focus the selected tab, and tabbing again should leave the tablist.</li>
        <li>The <code>Left arrow</code> and <code>Right arrow</code> keys - moving focus between tabs is done by arrows, not the <code>Tab</code> key.</li>
        <li>The <code>Home</code> key moves the focus to the first tab.</li>
        <li>The <code>End</code> key moves the focus to the last tab.</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    Note: Focusing the tab automatically activates it.
</details>
<details>
    <summary>
    <span>Wrong &quot;Google&quot; link location.</span>
  </summary>
    The Google link leads to apple.com, however, it should be leading to google.com.
</details>
<details>
    <summary>
    <span>The contrast of the currently selected tab is too low.</span>
  </summary>
    The color used to highlight the active tab against the inactive tabs is barely visible with low contrast.
</details>
<details>
    <summary>
    <span>Color is used alone to style links in the text.</span>
  </summary>
    Color alone is not a sufficient way to distinguish links from normal text. Low-vision or color-blind users would miss that completely, except for when the color contrast is very high.
</details>
<details>
    <summary>
    <span><code>max-height</code> is used on the tab panel.</span>
  </summary>
    The tab panel limits the height of the content inside even without using a vertical scrollbar. On smaller resolutions (or with more content), users would lose a part of the content.
</details>

### Considerations

The usage of certain techniques depends on the circumstances. Expand each consideration to learn more.

<details>
    <summary>
    <span>Consider changing the tab switch from hover to click event.</span>
  </summary>
    Hovering over something should not ideally cause a change in context, but there are exceptions. Tabs are usually switched either by activation or by selecting them by arrows.
</details>
<details>
    <summary>
    <span>Consider making the tabpanel focusable.</span>
  </summary>
    If there are no focusable elements in panels, users might miss the content in the panel. In such situations, it is recommended to put the <code>tabindex=&quot;0&quot;</code> to the tabpanel.
</details>
<details>
    <summary>
    <span>Consider using links or buttons as tabs.</span>
  </summary>
    Depending on the circumstances, tabs can also be developed as buttons or links (anchors). This should depend on the content importance and amount.
</details>
