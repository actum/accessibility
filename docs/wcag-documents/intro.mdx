WCAG is short for [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/). These guidelines explain how to make web content more accessible to people with various abilities and disabilities. People involved in web development should know and follow these guidelines. They are especially important for designers, developers, content creators, and people who test websites. Following these guidelines makes sure websites meet the minimum accessibility standards.

We encourage you to visit the official [WCAG overview](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) to learn more.

Our simplified WCAG documents explain the information from the official guidelines more briefly. Learn the essential information to get a basic understanding of the guidelines.

WCAG documents are a supportive study material of the web accessibility topic.

:::note
WCAG Documents are not trying to re-create WCAG, nor to improve it. The project aims to introduce WCAG for people who want to get the basic knowledge first and then study it in detail at the official guidelines. We also want to help those who are better auditory and visual learners to learn from videos.
:::

There are also videos to explain the guidelines. We are working on creating more content and videos, so stay tuned for updates.

Check the following video that gives you an introduction to the project.

## Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

WCAG includes four main principles that explain what web content should be:

1. **Perceivable**
2. **Operable**
3. **Understandable**
4. **Robust**

Each principle is then divided into different guidelines. The purpose of guidelines is to group and understand the success criteria.

Success criteria are what determine conformance to WCAG. This means that to meet WCAG, the content needs to meet the success criteria. They describe how to make the web content more accessible.

The success criteria have three levels of conformance to meet. Each with increasing difficulty: Level A, level AA, and level AAA.

**Level A** criteria are essential for all websites. If a website does not meet level A standards, it may have serious accessibility issues. These issues make it difficult or impossible for users with disabilities to use the website.

**Level AA** criteria are recommended as a minimum to meet. Websites that meet the level AA are accessible to a wider range of users.

**Level AAA** criteria represent the highest WCAG conformance level. Not all websites may be able to achieve these standards because they would often need a lot of resources to meet them. But some of them can be affordable even for regular websites.

## 1 - Perceivable
