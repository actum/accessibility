# WCAG Documents

<img src="/img/wcag-documents.png" srcSet="/img/wcag-documents.png 1x, /img/wcag-documents-2x.png 2x" alt="" width="600" height="400" style={{ aspectRatio: '600/400'}} loading="eager" />

WCAG Documents are simplified version of [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](#web-content-accessibility-guidelines), and they explain the information from the official guidelines more briefly, sometimes in a different way, and are a **supportive source of study material of the web accessibility** topic. The documents can help you to learn the essential information to understand and develop more accessible websites.

:::note
WCAG Documents are not trying to re-create WCAG, nor to improve it. The purpose of the project is to provide a brief introduction to WCAG for people who want to obtain the basic knowledge first, and then study it to the very detail at the official guidelines.
:::

There are also videos (explaining the guidelines) available for each document. Check the following video that gives you an introduction to the project.

## Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

The WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) explain **how to make web content more accessible** to people with various abilities and disabilities. It is **a standardized set of principles, guidelines, and success criteria** that developers, designers, quality assurance engineers, content editors, and anyone building websites should follow in order to be [conformant](/docs/wcag-documents/glossary-of-terms#conformance) with the rules and meet at least the minimum required level of accessibility of their websites.

We encourage all who are responsible for web accessibility in their organization to study the topic on the official [WCAG overview website](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) and also from different sources to learn more.

Web content accessibility guidelines are structured into 4 main principles that describe requirements for websites:

1. **Perceivable**
2. **Operable**
3. **Understandable**
4. **Robust**

Each principle is then divided into different **guidelines**. The purpose of guidelines is to group and understand the success criteria.

**Success criteria** are what determine conformance to WCAG which means in order to meet WCAG, the content needs to meet the success criteria. They describe how to make web content more accessible.

The success criteria have three levels of **conformance** to meet, each with increasing difficulty: Level A, level AA, and level AAA.

**Level A** criteria are essential for all websites. If the website does not conform with level A, it may have serious accessibility issues that prevent users with disabilities from using it.

**Level AA** criteria are recommended as a minimum to meet. Websites that meet the level AA are accessible to a wider range of users in various circumstances.

**Level AAA** criteria represent the highest WCAG conformance level. They may not be applicable for all websites to achieve as they usually require significant resources for conformance, however, some of them are affordable even for standard sites.
