<dl>
  <dt id="accessibility-tree">accessibility tree</dt>
  <dd>a subset of the DOM (Document Object Model) tree containing elements exposed to assistive technologies. Only elements that can have, for instance, accessible name, role, and value are included there.

  <dt id="accessible-name">accessible name</dt>
  <dd>a <a href="#programmaticaly-determined">programmaticaly determined</a> name of a user interface element that is included in the <a href="#accessibility-tree">accessibility tree</a>. The accessible name of the <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> element, for example, can be determined from the text content inside, <code>aria-label</code> attribute, or <code>aria-labelledby</code> attribute reference.</dd>

  <dt id="audio-descriptions">audio descriptions</dt>
  <dd>an audio track that narrates the relevant visual information contained in a video, such as actions, characters, scene changes, or on-screen text.</dd>
