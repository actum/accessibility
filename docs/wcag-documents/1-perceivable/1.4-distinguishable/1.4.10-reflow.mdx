## Intent

Ensure content adapts to screen size without two-dimensional scrolling.

## Who Benefits

- People with **low vision** can enlarge content and view it without the need to scroll horizontally and reading long lines.
- Anyone, but especially users who **struggle with reading**, do not need to navigate in both directions to read content.

## Reflow

Reflow refers to the ability of web content to adjust and adapt to various screen sizes and zoom levels. It ensures that content can be presented in a single column (or space that fits the viewport) without the need for scrolling horizontally. This process involves dynamically rearranging, resizing, and repositioning content to maintain readability and usability across different devices and conditions. Such as when the text size is increased up to 400%. This is called responsive web design.

## Exceptions

Two-dimensional scrolling is acceptable for content that requires it for usage or meaning, such s maps, diagrams, videos, or games.

## Tips

To meet this success criterion, you can follow these tips:
- **Implement responsive web design principles** to ensure content reflows appropriately. Use CSS media queries to adjust content layout at different zoom levels or screen sizes.
- **Avoid fixed-width** containers that can prevent content from reflowing.
- **Test your website at various zoom levels**, especially at 400%, to ensure content reflows to a single column without horizontal scrolling.

## Examples

### Correct Usage

The following example shows the correct usage or implementation of accessibility.

#### Example 1: Accessible Event Flyer

An event flyer is created using HTML and CSS, allowing text like date, time, and location to be resized and recolored according to user preferences, rather than as a static image.

<img
  src="/img/1.4.9-example-correct.jpg"
  srcSet="/img/1.4.9-example-correct.jpg 1x, /img/1.4.9-example-correct-2x.jpg 2x"
  alt="An event flyer titled Accessvale Arts & Crafts Festival, showing event description, date, and location."
  width="600"
  height="430"
  style={{ aspectRatio: '600/430' }}
/>

### Incorrect Usage

The following example shows incorrect usage or implementation of accessibility.

#### Example 1: Important Information in an Image

A web page displays its contact information as an image containing fancy-styled text. This method does not allow users to adjust the text properties, such as font family, font size, or color, potentially making the information inaccessible to those with visual impairments.

## Test Your Knowledge

<details>
  <summary>
    <span>
      Website hides main navigation under the hamburger menu on small screen resolutions, making the content invisible without opening the menu. Is this a violation of WCAG 1.4.10 - Reflow?
    </span>
  </summary>
  No, it is not a violation. The content is still accessible in the menu, it was just moved elsewhere since there is not enough reasonable space on small screens to render the main navigation.
