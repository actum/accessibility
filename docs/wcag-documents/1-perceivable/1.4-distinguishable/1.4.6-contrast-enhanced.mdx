# 1.4.6 - Contrast (Enhanced) - AAA

(future video slot)

## Intent

Text has enough contrast against its background color.

:::info
All of the points from the [1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) - AA](./1.4.3-contrast-minimum.mdx) apply to this criterion; only the contrast ratio requirements are more strict.
:::

### Contrast Ratio

The contrast ratio is a way to measure how much one color stands out from another.

This criterion contains requirements for two types of text:

- Normal text - text that has less than <strong>24px</strong> or <strong>18.5px in bold</strong> needs to have a contrast ratio at least <strong>7:1</strong>.
- Large text - text that has at least <strong>24px</strong> or <strong>18.5px</strong> in bold needs to have a contrast ratio at least <strong>4.5:1</strong>.

These ratio requirements are the only difference between Contrast (Minimum) and Contrast (Enhanced) criteria. To sum it up:

- In 1.4.3 - Contrast (Minimum) - AA, the contrast needs to be at least 4.5:1 for text and 3:1 for large text.
- In 1.4.6 - Contrast (Enhanced) - AAA, the contrast needs to be at least 7:1 for text and 4.5:1 for large text.

## Examples

### Correct Usage

The following example shows the correct usage or implementation of accessibility.

#### Example 1: Sufficient Contrast

Dark, almost black text is placed over a light, almost white background color. The color contrast of these two colors is 11.44:1. It has a large contrast ratio, way beyond the minimum requirements, and is easy to read.

### Incorrect Usage

The following example shows incorrect usage or implementation of accessibility.

#### Example 1: Insufficient Contrast

Dark red text is placed over a dark black background color. The color contrast of these two colors is 1.38:1. It has a very low contrast ratio below the minimum requirements and is hard to read.

## Test Your Knowledge

<details>
  <summary>
    <span>Is a website compliant with WCAG 1.4.6 - Contrast (Enhanced) if it uses black text (#000) on a white background (#FFF) for its main content?</span>
  </summary>
  Yes, it is compliant. Using black text on a white background creates the largest possible contrast ratio.
