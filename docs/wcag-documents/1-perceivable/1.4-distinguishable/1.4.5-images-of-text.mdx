# 1.4.5 - Images of Text - AA

(future video slot)

## Intent

Use real text instead of images of text.

## Who Benefits

People with low vision can easily modify font size, color, and contrast to read text comfortably.
People with dyslexia or other reading disorders can benefit from customized text settings like font type, size, and spacing for easier reading.
People who use assistive technologies can seamlessly access and interpret text content

- People with **low vision** can increase the text size and are able to read it.
- People with **tired eyes** can increase the text size so reading is more comfortable.
- People having devices with a **small screen** or a **distant screen** (such as a TV) can increase the text size to be able to read it.

##
## Exceptions

Captions and images of text are not included in requirements of this criterion.

## Examples

### Correct Usage

The following example shows the correct usage or implementation of accessibility.

#### Example 1: Relative Font Units

A website uses relative (`rem`) units for defining font sizes. When users change their font size in the browser settings, the browser respects this setting and renders the font in the size the user sets. For instance, a user with low vision may adjust their browser settings to make the text larger.

#### Example 2: Meta Viewport

A website is designed to be fully responsive. In its HTML, it has the following <code>meta viewport</code> tag: <pre>&lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1&quot; /&gt;</pre>

This setting allows users to freely zoom in and out on the content, accommodating their needs for larger text.

### Incorrect Usage

The following example shows incorrect usage or implementation of accessibility.

#### Example 1: Fixed Height

A news portal has its article sections styled with CSS, where the text containers have fixed heights. When a user with impaired vision increases the browser's default text size, the text within these containers overflows, becoming invisible or getting cut off. The fixed height of the containers doesn't allow the text to reflow, resulting in inaccessible content for users who need larger text.

#### Example 2: Meta Viewport

A website uses a restrictive meta viewport tag in its HTML: <pre>&lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;user-scalable=no, maximum-scale=1&quot; /&gt;</pre>

This prevents users from zooming into the web pages. A user trying to enlarge the text for better readability finds that they are unable to zoom in at all. This limitation makes using the website difficult for users with visual impairments.

  <summary>
    <span>Is a website compliant with WCAG 1.4.4 - Resize Text if its text can be resized, but certain text elements like buttons or navigation menus do not resize?</span>
  </summary>
  No, it is not compliant. WCAG 1.4.4 - Resize Text requires all text elements, including buttons and navigation menus, to be resizable. If certain elements do not resize, it can impact the usability of the website for users with visual impairments.
