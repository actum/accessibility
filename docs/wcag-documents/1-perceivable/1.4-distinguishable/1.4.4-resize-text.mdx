# 1.4.4 - Resize Text - AA

(future video slot)

## Intent

Text can be enlarged up 200% without loss of content or functionality.

## Who Benefits

- People with **low vision** can increase the text size and are able to read it.
- People with **tired eyes** can increase the text size so reading is more comfortable.
- People having devices with a **small screen** or a **distant screen** (such as a TV) can increase the text size to be able to read it.

## Text

This criterion covers not only standard text like paragraphs, headings, and lists but also text-based controls such as buttons or input fields.

### Resizing Text

Users must be able to resize text up to 200% without assistive technologies, including:

- **Operating system settings**: Adjusting text size settings in the device's operating system.
- **Browser zoom**: Using the browser's zoom feature to enlarge webpage content.
- **Browser font size settings**: Changing the default font size in browser settings.

Although not required by WCAG, testing even further, for example, with 500% increase, can help ensure even better accessibility.

Remember, using tools like screen magnifiers or third-party browser extensions are considered assistive technologies and do not count towards meeting this criterion.

## Exceptions

Captions and images of text are not included in requirements of this criterion.
