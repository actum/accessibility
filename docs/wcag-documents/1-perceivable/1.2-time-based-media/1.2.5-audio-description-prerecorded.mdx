## Intent

Enable people who are blind or visually impaired to understand the visual information in [synchronized media](/docs/wcag-documents/glossary-of-terms#synchronized-media) by providing [audio descriptions](/docs/wcag-documents/glossary-of-terms#audio-descriptions).

:::info
All of the points about the audio description from the [1.2.3 Audio Description or Media Alternative (Prerecorded) - A](./1.2.3-audio-description-or-media-alternative-prerecorded.mdx) apply to this criterion, the rest (about the [transcript](/docs/wcag-documents/glossary-of-terms#transcript)) is not a part of this criterion.
:::

## Conformance

Three WCAG criteria overlap with each other due to the [conformance](/docs/wcag-documents/glossary-of-terms#conformance):

- [1.2.3 - Audio Description or Media Alternative (Prerecorded) - A](./1.2.3-audio-description-or-media-alternative-prerecorded.mdx) - you must include **transcript OR audio description** to comply with the criterion.
- 1.2.5 - Audio Description (Prerecorded) - AA (this criterion) - you must include **audio description** to comply with the criterion.
- [1.2.8 - Media Alternative (Prerecorded) - AAA](./1.2.8-media-alternative-prerecorded.mdx) - you must include **transcript** to comply with the criterion.

These 3 criteria exist to give you a choice for a minimum conformance level:
- If you want to conform only to level A, you can choose between including either **transcript** or **audio description**.
- If you want to conform to level AA, including only audio description is enough for the conformance. However, including both **transcript** and **audio description** is best for users.
- If you want to conform to level AAA, you must include both the **transcript** and the **audio description**, because in order to conform to level AAA you also need to meet all the level A and AA criteria first.

## Test Your Knowledge

<details>
	<summary>
    <span>A webpage contains a video with audio descriptions. What WCAG level it conforms to, considering criterions 1.2.3, 1.2.5, and 1.2.8?</span>
  </summary>
	The webpage conforms to AA because the level A is met by providing an audio description OR transcript, and the level AA is met by providing an audio description. If the video would contain a transcript too, it would conform to level AAA.
