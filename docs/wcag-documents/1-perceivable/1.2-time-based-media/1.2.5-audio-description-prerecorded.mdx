# 1.2.5 - Audio Description (Prerecorded) - AA

(future video slot)

## Intent

Enable people who are blind or visually impaired to understand the visual information in [synchronized media](/docs/wcag-documents/glossary-of-terms#synchronized-media) by providing [audio descriptions](/docs/wcag-documents/glossary-of-terms#audio-descriptions).

:::info
All of the points about the audio description from the [1.2.3 Audio Description or Media Alternative (Prerecorded) - A](./1.2.3-audio-description-or-media-alternative-prerecorded.mdx) apply for this criterion, the rest (about the [transcript](/docs/wcag-documents/glossary-of-terms#transcript)) is not a part of this criterion.
:::

## Conformance

Three WCAG criteria overlap with each other due to the conformance:

- [1.2.3 Audio Description or Media Alternative (Prerecorded) - A](./1.2.3-audio-description-or-media-alternative-prerecorded.mdx) - you must include **transcript OR audio description** to comply with the level A.
- 1.2.5 Audio Description (Prerecorded) - AA (this criterion) - you must include **audio description** to comply with the level AA.
- 1.2.8 Media Alternative (Prerecorded) - AAA (future link) - you must include both **transcript** AND **audio description** to comply with the level AAA.

## Test Your Knowledge

<details>
	<summary><span>A webpage contains a video with audio descriptions. What WCAG level it conforms to, considering criterions 1.2.3, 1.2.5, and 1.2.8?</span></summary>
	The webpage conforms to AA because the level A is met by providing an audio description OR transcript, and the level AA is met by providing an audio description. If the video would contain a transcript too, it would conform to level AAA.
