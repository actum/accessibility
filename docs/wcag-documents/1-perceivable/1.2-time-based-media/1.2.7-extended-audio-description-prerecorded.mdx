## Intent

Provide people who are blind or visually impaired access to a [synchronized media](/docs/wcag-documents/glossary-of-terms#synchronized-media) presentation beyond that which can be provided by standard [audio description](/docs/wcag-documents/glossary-of-terms#audio-descriptions).

:::info
All of the points about the extended audio description from the [1.2.3 Audio Description or Media Alternative (Prerecorded) - A](./1.2.3-audio-description-or-media-alternative-prerecorded.mdx) apply to this criterion, the rest (about the [transcript](/docs/wcag-documents/glossary-of-terms#transcript)) is not a part of this criterion.

## Examples

### Correct Usage

The following example shows the correct usage or implementation of accessibility.

#### Example 1: Video Player with Extended Audio Descriptions

[Able Player](https://ableplayer.github.io/ableplayer/) is a fully accessible cross-browser media player. See the example [Extended audio description via video swap](https://ableplayer.github.io/ableplayer/demos/desc4.html).
The example uses a separate video to deliver an extended audio description. If audio descriptions are toggled on, users get the described version; otherwise, they get the non-described version.

<details>
	<summary>
    <span>What is the difference between standard and extended audio descriptions?</span>
  </summary>
  Standard audio description provides a basic narration of the visual elements of a video and is inserted into natural pauses in the audio. Extended audio description is more detailed, providing additional information about what is happening in the video, and it usually requires pauses in the video to accommodate the extra information.
