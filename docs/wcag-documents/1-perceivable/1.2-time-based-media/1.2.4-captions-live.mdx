# 1.2.4 - Captions (Live) - AA

(future video slot)

## Intent

Enable people who are deaf or hard of hearing to understand the auditory information in real-time [synchronized media](/docs/wcag-documents/glossary-of-terms#synchronized-media) by providing captions.

:::info
All of the points from the [1.2.2 Captions (Prerecorded) - A](./1.2.2-captions-prerecorded.mdx) apply for this criterion, except for open captions, as it is not likely the open captions will be present in the live media.
:::

## Real-time or Live media

Real-time (or live) media include live news broadcasts, live sports commentaries, live webinars, live events broadcasts, and similar.

## Techniques

There are currently 3 techniques how to include the real-time captioning:

### Communication Access Realtime Translation (CART)

Also called real-time stenography - a system that stenographers and others use to convert speech to text. A highly skilled operator writes the exact words spoken using a special keyboard.

:::info
A stenographer is a person who makes a written verbatim record using a unique shortened writing style called "steno" on a steno machine.

### Automated Voice Recognition Service Provided by a Shadow Speaker

<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/300x150" alt="" width="300" height="150" style={{aspectRatio: '2/1' }} />

A highly skilled speaker repeats spoken content into a microphone and specialized voice recognition software (trained to a specific person's voice) interprets the speech as text and facilitates text correction and customization.

### Automated Speech Recognition Software

An accurate software on a similar level as CART that automatically converts speech to text.

## Examples

### Correct Usage

The following example shows the correct usage or implementation of accessibility.

#### Example 1: CART

See a showcase of the [Communication Access Realtime Translation (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7koiXCgECc).

### Incorrect Usage

The following example shows incorrect usage or implementation of accessibility.

#### Example 1: No Live Captioning

Not including live captions in live news broadcasts, sports commentaries, or webinars is excluding people who cannot hear the audio track.

## Test Your Knowledge

<details>
	<summary>A stenographer repeats spoken content into a microphone so voice recognition software can interpret the speech as text. True or false?</summary>
  False - a stenographer writes, whereas a shadow speaker speaks.

<details>
  <summary>Synchronized media is audio or video content synchronized with another format for presenting information. True or false?</summary>
  True - no catch here.
