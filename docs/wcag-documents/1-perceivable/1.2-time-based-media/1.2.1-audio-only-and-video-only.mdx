# 1.2.1 - Audio-only and Video-only (Prerecorded) - A

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/31LRIj8cIH8" title="1.2.1 - Audio-only and Video-only (Prerecorded) - WCAG Documents" frameBorder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowFullscreen></iframe>

## Intent

Make prerecorded (not live) audio-only and video-only content accessible through text or [media alternatives](/docs/wcag-documents/glossary-of-terms#media-alternative).

## Who Benefits

- People who **cannot see** a video can listen to an alternative audio track or can have the text alternative announced by a [screen reader](/docs/wcag-documents/glossary-of-terms#screen-reader).
- People who **cannot hear** an audio track can read the text alternative.
- People who **cannot both see and hear** can have the text alternative perceived by a [braille display](/docs/wcag-documents/glossary-of-terms#braille-display).
- People who cannot play the audio because they are in a **noisy or quiet environment** where they can't hear it or don't want to disturb others can read the text alternative.
- People having **difficulties understanding** audio or video information due to language or cognitive issues, for example, can benefit from reading the text alternative in parallel.
- People **searching for content** in search engines or on the page benefit from having content text alternatives.
- People who **won't spend the time to listen** to the audio or watch the video can just read the [transcript](/docs/wcag-documents/glossary-of-terms#transcript) or its parts quickly.
- People with **low bandwidth connections** who don't want to download larger audio or video files or don't want to pay for bandwidth by downloading large files.
- **SEO** (Search engine optimization) indexing is possible thanks to the text content.

## Media Alternatives

This criterion covers two types of media alternatives.

### Audio-only

<img src="/img/1.2.1-audio-only.png" srcSet="/img/1.2.1-audio-only.png 1x, /img/1.2.1-audio-only-2x.png 2x" alt="An audio player with the play button, elapsed and total time text, timeline slider, and the 'more options' button." width="400" height="100" style={{aspectRatio: '400/100' }} />

Audio recordings of speeches, podcasts, ...

Provide a **text transcript** that conveys the same information as the audio.

```html
<audio>
	<source src="track.mp3" type="audio">
</audio>

<h3>Transcript</h3>
<p>[00:00:00] (John) Hello! In this video, we will cover keyboard access and visual focus.</p>
<p>[00:00:05] Many people cannot use a mouse and rely on the keyboard to interact with web content.</p>
(the full transcript text continues...)
```

### Video-only

<img src="/img/1.2.1-video-only.png" srcSet="/img/1.2.1-video-only.png 1x, /img/1.2.1-video-only-2x.png 2x" alt="An video player with the play buttons, elapsed and total time text, timeline slider, and the 'options', 'change view', 'fullscreen', and 'volume' buttons." width="400" height="250" style={{aspectRatio: '400/250' }} />

Silent movies, animations, ...

Provide a **text transcript** or **an audio track** that conveys the same information.

```html
<a href="mars-landing.mp4">Mars landing video</a>
<a href="mars-landing-audio-description.mp3">Audio description of "Mars Landing"</a>
```

## Exceptions

The alternative does not have to be provided if the content itself is the alternative.
For instance, if video-only content has an audio track as an alternative, the audio track itself does not need to have a text alternative.

## Examples

### Correct Usage

The following example shows the correct usage or implementation of accessibility.

#### Example 1: Transcript of Podcast

A button with a "play" icon and the visible text "Play Episode 1: Introduction to Web Accessibility" followed by a short description of the episode and a link to the transcript below followed by a download link and a share button.

```html title="Podcast transcript example"
<button class="btn--play">Play Episode 1: Introduction to Web Accessibility</button>

<p>Get to know what web accessibility is and what impact it has.</p>

<a href="/episode-01-transcript">Transcript</a>
<a href="/episode-01.mp3">Download podcast as MP3 (1.45 MB)</a>
<button>Share the episode</button>
```

### Incorrect Usage

The following example shows incorrect usage or implementation of accessibility.

#### Example 1: Transcript of Podcast

A button with a "play" icon and the visible text "Play Episode 1: Introduction to Web Accessibility" followed by a short description of the episode, a download link, and a share button.

There is no mention of a transcript anywhere, so the podcast is inaccessible to people who need the transcript.

```html title="Podcast transcript example"
<button class="btn--play">Play Episode 1: Introduction to Web Accessibility</button>

<p>Get to know what web accessibility is and what impact it has.</p>

<a href="/episode-01.mp3">Download podcast as MP3 (1.45 MB)</a>
<button>Share the episode</button>
```

## Test Your Knowledge

<details>
	<summary><span>What are the requisites for the transcript’s content?</span></summary>
	The transcript must have identified speakers (if there’s more than one) and must cover all dialogues and important sound effects. It may also contain timestamps when necessary.
</details>

<details>
	<summary><span>What technique would you use to link media with the transcript?</span></summary>
	Place a link to the transcript, or put the transcript itself as close as possible to the media content.
