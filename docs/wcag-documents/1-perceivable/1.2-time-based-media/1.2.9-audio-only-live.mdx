## Intent

Make information conveyed by live audio accessible through the use of a text alternative.

:::info
All of the points about the [transcript](/docs/wcag-documents/glossary-of-terms/#transcript) text alternative from the [1.1.1 - Non-text Content - A](../1.1-text-alternatives/1.1.1-non-text-content.mdx) apply to this criterion, the rest (about other text alternatives) is not a part of this criterion.

Also, all of the points about the live captions from the [1.2.4 - Captions (Live) - AA](./1.2.4-captions-live.mdx) apply to this criterion.

## Live Audio

Live audio is any form of real-time audio that is currently streaming. It may include live podcasts, sport events, news, auctions, speeches, and more.

Live audio can be made accessible by using **live captions**. A **transcript** can sometimes be used too when the live audio is following a set script, but live captions are preferred as the spoken content might either deviate from the transcript or plays out at a different pace.

Using operators without adequate training, or providing a transcript that differs considerably from the actual events, would not be considered to meet this success criterion.
