# 1.2.8 - Media Alternative (Prerecorded) - AAA

(future video slot)

## Intent

Make audiovisual material available to individuals whose vision is too poor to read captions and whose hearing is too poor to hear dialogue and [audio descriptions](/docs/wcag-documents/glossary-of-terms#audio-descriptions) by providing an alternative in a text form.

:::info
All of the points about the [transcript](/docs/wcag-documents/glossary-of-terms/#transcript) text alternative from the [1.1.1 - Non-text Content - A](../1.1-text-alternatives/1.1.1-non-text-content.mdx) apply to this criterion, the rest (about other text alternatives) is not a part of this criterion.

## Conformance

Three WCAG criteria overlap with each other due to the conformance:

- [1.2.3 - Audio Description or Media Alternative (Prerecorded) - A](./1.2.3-audio-description-or-media-alternative-prerecorded.mdx) - you must include **transcript OR audio description** to comply with the criterion.
- [1.2.5 - Audio Description (Prerecorded) - AA](./1.2.5-audio-description-prerecorded.mdx) - you must include **audio description** to comply with the criterion.
- 1.2.8 - Media Alternative (Prerecorded) - AAA (this criterion) - you must include **transcript** to comply with the criterion.

These 3 criteria exist to give you a choice for a minimum conformance level:
- If you want to conform only to level A, you can choose between including either **transcript** or **audio description**.
- If you want to conform to level AA, including only audio description is enough for the conformance. However, including both **transcript** and **audio description** is best for users.
- If you want to conform to level AAA, you must include both the **transcript** and the **audio description**, because in order to conform to level AAA you also need to meet all the level A and AA criteria first.

## Test Your Knowledge

<details>
	<summary><span>The transcript needs to include all dialogues, but does not have to describe the visual information. True or false?</span></summary>
	False - The transcript must have identified speakers (if there is more than one) and must cover all dialogues, important sound effects (laughter, off-screen voices, etc.), and all visual information including actions and expressions of actors. It may also contain timestamps when necessary.
