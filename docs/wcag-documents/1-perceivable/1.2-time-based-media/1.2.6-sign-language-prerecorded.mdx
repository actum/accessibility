## Intent

Enable people who are deaf or hard of hearing and who are fluent in sign language to understand the auditory information in the [synchronized media](/docs/wcag-documents/glossary-of-terms#synchronized-media) by providing a sign language interpretation.

## Who Benefits

- People who **cannot hear** an audio content of a video can watch a sign language interpretation to understand the content.
- People who have **limited reading ability** and are not able to read captions (including language barriers and speed rate) can understand the content thanks to the sign language interpretation.

## Sign Language

Sign language is a system of communication using visual gestures and signs, as used by deaf people.

### Interesting Facts

- Sign language conveys **emotion**, **intonation**, **expression**, and other dynamics that may not be accurately expressed via written text.
- Written text is a **second language** for users whose first language is sign language.
- People who communicate extensively in sign language may comprehend the content in sign language **faster and more accurately** than when they are reading written text in captions.

### Implementation

Any content provided in audio-only or audio-visual formats should include **clearly visible sign language interpretations** either in the main video or embedded as a picture-in-picture frame inside of the video.

Because there is **no universal sign language**, it is best to provide the interpretation in the language of the country that you are targeting.

Producing quality signed video assets requires **extensive planning** and **specialized skill sets**. There are tasks related to defining and verifying customer requirements, talent acquisition, content management, and environmental controls.

## Example

### Correct Usage

The following example shows the correct usage or implementation of accessibility.
