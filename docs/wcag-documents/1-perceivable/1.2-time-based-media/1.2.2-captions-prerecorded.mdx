## Intent

Enable people who are deaf or hard of hearing to understand the auditory information in prerecorded (not live) [synchronized media](#synchronized-media) by providing captions.

## Who Benefits

- People who **cannot hear** an audio content of a video can read synchronized captions to understand the content.
- People who have **difficulties understanding** the language of the audio track in a video can benefit from reading the captions in parallel.
- People in a **sound-sensitive environment** (such as a library or public transport) can understand the media content without audio.
- People who want to **hear and read the content at the same** time to understand it better benefit from captions.

## Synchronized Media

Synchronized media is audio or video content synchronized with another format for presenting information, such as:
- video + audio
- video + captions
- or video + [audio descriptions](/docs/wcag-documents/glossary-of-terms#audio-descriptions)

## Text Alternatives for Synchronized Media

Captions and subtitles are often considered the same thing, but there are some differences.

### Subtitles

<img src="/img/1.2.2-subtitles.png" srcSet="/img/1.2.2-subtitles.png 1x, /img/1.2.2-subtitles-2x.png 2x" alt="A video featuring a smiling character with outstretched arms, and subtites showing 'This is great.'." width="400" height="250" style={{aspectRatio: '400/250' }} />

Subtitles convey the content of the spoken dialogue only. The purpose is to translate spoken audio into a language the viewer understands.

### Captions

<img src="/img/1.2.2-captions.png" srcSet="/img/1.2.2-captions.png 1x, /img/1.2.2-captions-2x.png 2x" alt="A video featuring a smiling character with outstretched arms, and captions showing '[thinking] This is great.'." width="400" height="250" style={{aspectRatio: '400/250' }} />

Captions not only include the dialogue but also identify:

- who is speaking
- meaningful sound effects
- non-speech information conveyed through sound

There are two types of captions:

#### Open Captions
Open captions are part of the video and cannot be turned off.

A live example of open captions in a YouTube video: [You Guys Need Captions! - Pharrell "Happy" Parody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQWlYYFXM2M).

#### Closed Captions
Closed captions can be turned on and off by the viewer, usually with the possibility to change their color, size, position, and other styles.

:::note
If you turn off the sound of a video, you must not miss any important audio content.

## Examples

### Correct Usage

The following examples show the correct usage or implementation of accessibility.

#### Example 1: Captions

A video about the life of pigs picturing a pig running over grass while squealing. The video has captions, so people relying on captions can understand the pig is squealing.

<img src="/img/1.2.2-example-pig.png" srcSet="/img/1.2.2-example-pig.png 1x, /img/1.2.2-example-pig-2x.png 2x" alt="A video featuring a running, smiling pig, and captions showing '[pig squealing]'." width="400" height="250" style={{aspectRatio: '400/250' }} />

### Incorrect Usage

The following example shows incorrect usage or implementation of accessibility.

#### Example 1: Missing Captions

A video picturing a dialogue between two people. The dialogue is an essential part of the video, and because there are no available captions, users who rely on captions completely miss important auditory information.

<img src="/img/1.2.2-example-captions.png" srcSet="/img/1.2.2-example-captions.png 1x, /img/1.2.2-example-captions-2x.png 2x" alt="A video with no available captions featuring characters having a conversation." width="400" height="250" style={{aspectRatio: '400/250' }} />

## Test Your Knowledge

<details>
	<summary><span>Must captions contain the exact text as is spoken?</span></summary>
  No, captions sometimes simplify the spoken text both to make it easier to read and to avoid forcing the viewer to read at a very high speed. This is a standard procedure and does not invalidate a caption.
</details>

<details>
	<summary><span>Can captions contain information that is not present in the media?</span></summary>
  No, captions presenting new information that is not available in the media itself are considered invalid.
</details>

<details>
	<summary><span>Are captions required for the alternate presentation of information already available in text on the page?</span></summary>
  No, captions are not required when the synchronized media is an alternate presentation of information that is already available in text on the page.
